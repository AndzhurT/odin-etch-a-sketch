### Odin Project
<hr>

Etch-A-Sketch is a project where you can draw and expand the canvas by clicking on buttons. It's a simple representation of the Paint app or some equivalent canvas apps. There are two buttons, one for resetting the board to a white canvas and one for manipulating the size of the canvas. You can change color by clicking on the color element.
